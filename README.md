# Incrementally Computing the Hypervolume of a Set of n-D Points for n=3 and 4
This repository contains the description and corresponding files for the " Incrementally computing the hypervolume of a set of n-D points for n=3 and 4" project.

This is a project for the master's subject "Matematika z raƒçunalnikom" at University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. 

## Description
The hypervolume of a set of n-D points is often used in multi-objective optimization and serves as a measure of tracking the progress of optimization algorithms.

The goal of this project is to transfer the most computationally efficient implementation of the incremental hypervolume computation for 3-D and 4-D spaces, which is written in C, into Python.
